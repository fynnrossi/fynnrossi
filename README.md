# 👋 Hey there, I’m Fynn!

I’m a lifelong problem‑solver who follows my curiosity wherever it leads—whether that’s optimizing housing searches or building niche apps for gamers. I started out as an aspiring developer in the Finance world, and today I work as a Product Manager by day, crafting side projects by night to see where my curiosity takes me.
